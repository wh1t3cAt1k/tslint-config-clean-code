# 2.0.0

Breaking changes:

1. We now recommend [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) for all your code formatting. The rules related to whitespace, indents, etc. have all been disabled.
2. [`no-arrow-functions](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/only-arrow-functions/) is now enabled to ensure that `this` is always properly bound.

# 1.1.0

Breaking change: extended [`tslint-no-circular-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-no-circular-imports) configuration.
